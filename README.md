## fight-club-to-anki

Roll a character pretty quick? Fight Club 5e is great. Remember what the heck
the character does/is? Maybe you need some study help. This builds a quick Anki
deck for reviewing your feats/items/notes.

## How do I use this?

Export characters individually as `.xml` files from the application and drop them in the `characters/` folder.

Run `pipenv install` and `script/convert` to convert them into apkgs.

Use Anki to import that file into your client.
